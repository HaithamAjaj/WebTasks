			<p>My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is Cupcake, so Cookie Monster cupcake are the best of both worlds.</p>
			<p>Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, "Sometimes me thinks what is love, and me think love is what last cookie is for. 
			Me give up the last cookie for you." I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes.</p>
